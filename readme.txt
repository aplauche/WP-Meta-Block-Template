Example of creating structured CPTs with a meta block 

== Description ==

This plugin creates a "property" custom post type with several pieces of meta data associated with it.

A block is also created that hooks into this meta data. The block is limited to the custom post type and locked as part of the template by default.

This pattern allows the creation of CPTs that have structured data that can be edited entirely through the native gutenberg interface.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-meta-block-template` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
